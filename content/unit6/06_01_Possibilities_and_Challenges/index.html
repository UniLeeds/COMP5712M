                        <p>The nature of programming has changed rapidly over the past 50 years. Changes have mainly followed directions that relate to key features that have been found to increase ease of programming and reliability. These primarily come
                            under the following headings:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 id="abstraction">Abstraction<a class="headerlink" href="#abstraction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
                        <p>Abstraction in the way we program has come a long way since the original programs that were coded directly in the machine instructions that are processed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>                            devices of computers. Here are a couple of ideas of how abstraction could be taken even further.</p>
                        <h5 id="virtualisation-and-cloud-computing">Virtualisation and cloud computing<a class="headerlink" href="#virtualisation-and-cloud-computing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>Modern computing is dominated by distributed services for which information storage and computational resources are provided by
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage"><em>the cloud</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> resources.
                        </p>
                        <p>Virtualisation is the process of creating a virtual version of something. You may think that virtualisation involves an abstraction away from physical implementation details. This is true from a hardware perspective: a specific
                            physical computational device has been replaced by a program or collection of programs, which has the same computational functionality as the physical computer.</p>
                        <p>However, from a programming point of view, virtualisation is almost the opposite of abstraction. In writing a program to run on a virtual machine in the cloud we write code as if it is running on conventional hardware (for example,
                            we load and save files in the same way as we would when they are stored on our local hard drive).</p>
                        <p>These files may only exist within the memory of a remote machine or the file content could be distributed between different segments of memory (or disk on many different machines). So how would we abstract away from physical implementation
                            details from a programming point of view?</p>
                        <h5 id="abstraction-from-physical-implementation-details">Abstraction from physical implementation details<a class="headerlink" href="#abstraction-from-physical-implementation-details" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>Traditional programming languages are built upon a conception of programming that is tightly bound to the particular physical objects and mechanisms that support the information processing capability of computers. This is why we
                            normally think of data in terms of storage devices (ROM and RAM), files, records, text strings, etc.; and we consider computation in terms in terms of complex procedures for manipulating symbols by means of a specific predetermined
                            sequence of steps.</p>
                        <p>However, when we consider computational processing purely in terms of information and possible transformations we may apply to it, the particular details of storage are irrelevant. Whether information is stored in a file, or in
                            memory in the form of some data structure, the transformations or extractions that may be applied to it are essentially the same (though of course it is usually faster to transform data in memory than on disc, and to keep data
                            safe it is wise to store it on disc, rather that in memory).</p>
                        <p>In fact, modern computer architectures already blur the differences between, say, a file and a data structure stored in memory. As mentioned above, what may appear to a programmer as a file often exists only in memory as part of
                            the data structure used to represent a virtual machine. And conversely, what appears to be a data structure may actually be stored on disk (as when <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/"><em>swap space</em></a>                            is used).</p>
                        <p>In the future, programming languages may treat data storage in a much more abstract and general way. Instead of writing code instructions to save data to a file, we would simply specify that the data should be stored in a persistent
                            way, so it would still be available after our program had finished, and perhaps also that it should be made available to other programs (e.g. via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>).
                            Instead of loading data from a file into memory, we would just declare that we want rapid access to a certain data object (which again might be specified by a URI). </p>
                        <h5 id="abstraction-from-specific-names-of-program-elements-and-components">Abstraction from specific names of program elements and components<a class="headerlink" href="#abstraction-from-specific-names-of-program-elements-and-components" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>From the point of view of computer program execution the specific names of variables, functions, classes, modules, packages, files etc. are arbitrary. They just provide means of establishing a connection between a place in a program
                            where a certain symbol string (for example, a variable name) is used and some location in memory or on disc where the the referent information object is stored.</p>
                        <p>To produce reliable and adaptable computer programs, you should abstract away from specific details to produce a more general solution. However, in assigning names to functions, classes and files, we associate specific sequences
                            of symbols to refer to these objects. With small programs this is not usually a problem. However, as systems become larger, languages incorporate more and more built-in functions and large numbers of modules and packages are
                            available for use, a programmer has to be aware of of a huge number of different names for both functional components and data objects.</p>
                        <p>In recent years there has been a massive growth in online documentation, and systems that organise and maintain this in a semi-automatic way have been developed (for example, websites such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/">docs.python.org</a>).
                            But it can be difficult to find what you are looking for unless you already know its name. For instance how would you know that a function that would be useful for you is in a package called
                            <code>pandas</code> or <code>numpy</code> or <code>cv2</code>, unless you already know the names of those packages and the kinds of functionality they support?</p>
                        <p>Ideally we would like to access program elements by means of a general method of organisation, not just by using specific names. It is currently unclear how this would be achieved. However, the idea of program semantics, and the
                            more established ideas regarding data semantics may provide a basis by which we can organise program elements primarily in terms of their meaning, rather than the names that programmers give to them.</p>
                        <h5 id="program-semantics">Program semantics<a class="headerlink" href="#program-semantics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p><em>Semantics</em> is the study of <em>meaning</em> and how we can describe and classify meanings. Originally, programming languages were treated as primarily <em>syntactic</em> objects, that is sequences of symbols. However, those
                            symbols do have a meaning in terms of what happens when they are executed. As programming languages have developed into much more structured forms, categorisations of data types and components such as functions, classes, methods,
                            modules, packages etc. bring out semantic structures and relationships among program elements. It is likely that this kind of structuring will be further developed so that more aspects of the meanings of functions and classes
                            will be made explicit. This may enable the organisation of programs to be more comprehensible, and provide a way to reduce the problem of dealing large numbers of disorganised names of program components that was highlighted
                            in the previous section.</p>
                        <h5 id="declarative-coding">Declarative coding<a class="headerlink" href="#declarative-coding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>In various previous lessons <em>declarative</em> programming languages were mentioned. The main advantage of a declarative approach is that it can improve intelligibility. It can be regarded as a form of abstraction in that the
                            declarative parts of a program need not specify how that declared information is to be used, and the parts of the program that use the declared information, do so in a general way that does not depend on the specific details
                            of the data. This can be a very powerful way of programming and is likely to become more prevalent.</p>
                        <h5 id="knowledge-based-programming">Knowledge-based programming<a class="headerlink" href="#knowledge-based-programming" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>Moving further into the future, it may be that rather than coding algorithms (or specific declarative information) to solve a specific problem, you could represent knowledge in a general way that could be flexibly applied to solve
                            a variety of problems. So instead of coding a program to implement particular functions, you would create a knowledge base. The knowledge base could could then be used for a variety of purposes, by means of a wide range of
                            queries or requests that can be answered or obeyed by the system.</p>
                        <p>In fact this kind of functionality already exists in some forms. For example when we use a Web search engine such as Google search, we are using the Web as a knowledge base and getting information back that is related to our query.
                            However, this kind of querying does not use genuine knowledge about the content of the Web; the search engine mainly just matches words in the query with words in documents on the web (though actually more and more semantic
                            information is being used by Google to control the way their search engine works).</p>
                        <p>Another way in which much more fully fledged knowledge-based programming can be implemented is by using a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming">logic programming</a> language such as
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> (e.g. <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI Prolog</a>). A Prolog program can act as a knowledge base and can answer queries by means of logical inference, so largely
                            fulfils the aspiration of knowledge-based programming. However, representing large amounts of knowledge in Prolog involves several difficulties:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>coding knowledge in a comprehensive and consistent way is a large and intricate task</li>
                            <li>Prolog programming is often error prone, unless the programmer has a sound grasp of how the language works</li>
                            <li>debugging can be difficult</li>
                            <li>query answering can be very inefficient unless the code has been very carefully designed</li>
                            <li>and efficiency can vary greatly according to the particular types of query that the program is given to evaluate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="modularity">Modularity<a class="headerlink" href="#modularity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
                        <p>As has been emphasised in several lessons of earlier units, modularity is a key concept in programming, which greatly facilitates the construction of large reliable systems. Modularity is also closely associated with encapsulation
                            and with portability. In recent years the most significant development connected to these attributes is probably <em>containerisation</em>.</p>
                        <h5 id="containerisation">Containerisation<a class="headerlink" href="#containerisation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h5>
                        <p>The idea of a <em>container</em> and <em>containerisation</em> has become very significant recently, especially in relation to cloud computing. (Note that in Python the word 'container' is used to mean a type of object that can
                            contain other object. Here we are talking about something different.) The two best known container technologies at the moment are
                            <a href="https://sylabs.io/singularity/">Singularity</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. The Docker website defines the concept of a container as follows:</p>
                        <p><em>"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all
 its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one
computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a
lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes
everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools,
system libraries and settings."</em> (from <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">docker.com</a>)</p>
                        <p>Probably the main reason to use containers is for <em>portability</em>. Code that depends on being run with a particular operating system system set-up because it makes use of a variety of other software components within that
                            system can be packaged up into a single container unit, which can be transported to another system and will still run. The Docker documentation describes their containers as 'lightweight' but a docker image could easily be
                            more than 1GB in size, so not exactly featherweight. However, 1GB is probably a lot smaller than the size of the whole file system that we would use to crate the software (which could be hundreds of GB).</p>
                        <p>Containers can also be regarded as providing a form of
                            <em>encapsulation</em> and they can also be used as modular units within larger systems. For instance the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> system provides a mechanism for <em>orchestrating</em> software services
                            that involve multiple containerised applications.</p>

                        <p><em>"I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."</em><br>                            (Linus Torvalds, 2006-08-28, <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/193245/">Message to Git mailing list</a>)</p>
                        <p>Hopefully the content of this module has demonstrated good reasons to believe that Linus is largely right (though I would say that there are also situations where good programmers will worry about algorithms). We can expect that
                            data and data structures will always play a significant role in programming; and, as long as programmers seek to develop new kinds of software, they will also create new forms of data structure. New kinds of data will require
                            new data structures for their representation and new algorithms will make use of new data structures in their implementation.</p>

                        <p>One type of data that is increasingly seen as important is <em>meta data</em>, or in other words data that specifies information about data. As systems deal with data that is more and more diverse and is integrated from many sources
                            there is a need to keep track of what data means and where it comes from. The field of
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_technology">Semantic Technology</a> deals with methods for representing and manipulating information about the meaning of data and for using this information to support various
                            kinds of application. There are two kinds of situation in which this is useful (often these occur together):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>You have complex data of many types and want to develop an application that can make use of interconnections between different data types. <br>For example, we may want to write software for managing a website and business
                                    procedure for a company selling many different kinds of products to a variety of customers. Both the products and customers may have many attributes and we need to ensure that complex conditions are satisfied to match
                                    customer requirements to product features.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>You need to combine data from several different sources.<br> For example we may want to integrate environmental data from many different countries to carry out a global analysis of some environmental conditions.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Precise specification of the semantics of a vocabulary of conceptual terms can be represented by means of logical languages. A specification of this kind is known as an
                            <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science" target="_blank">ontology</a></strong>. Various representations have been developed for computational representation of semantic information, such

                        <p>In many of the preceding lessons of this module we have seen that data can play a significant role in programming, not only in being an input that programs operate upon to produce output, but also in supporting and shaping the
                            functionality that programs deliver. As we have seen, the field of Data Science is continually developing new ways to extract information from data and Machine Learning explores ways to use data to achieve functionality that
                            we would be unable to accomplish by direct programming.</p>
                        <p>For a very interesting exploration of the possibilities opened up by using data a a driving force for computer applications you are recommended to watch the following video of a lecture by

                        <p>To <em>promulgate</em> an idea is to make it widely known by communicating it to anyone for whom it may be relevant. Traditionally, programming has focussed on constructing functions that produce some output from some input or
                            starting state. However, many other auxiliary programming related features and tools have arisen that are more about communicating the status, purpose and usage of code rather than defining the actual code functionality. Such
                            features range from those directly related to an algorithm's function, such as exception handling (e.g. Python's <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>), self verification (<code>assert</code>) and execution timing functions,
                            to features related to usage and maintenance, such as automatic documentation (e.g. via docstrings),
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> specifications and version control (<code>git</code>), as well as including more socially oriented features relating to programming communities (<code>github</code>, <code>Kaggle</code>)
                            and program distribution (<code>pip</code>, <code>conda</code>).</p>
                        <p>Such features have proved to be very useful and are increasingly popular. However, they form a very disparate collection of coding conventions and tools that each require separate investigation and investment of effort by programmers
                            before they can make use of them. It is likely that promulgation will become increasingly recognised as a key aspect of programming, and general frameworks for unifying different promulgation mechanisms will be designed. I
                            predict that in the future full-blown <em>promulgation languages</em> will be developed and will operate as wrappers around conventional code components. These will support a wide range of <em>meta</em> functionalities relating
                            to code development and usage. Ultimately it may be possible to create programs purely by promulgating specifications, requests and even payment offers, for required functionality: the actual algorithmic code would then be
                            obtained automatically from remote sources. Conversely, programmers who are interested in supplying or writing algorithms could promulgate details of what they can provide and be automatically paid for fulfilling requirements
                            of other system developers.</p>

                        <p>Now we look at a possibility that may put programmers out of a job.</p>
                        <p>The past was once the future; so, to form a view of the future, it may be revealing to survey the past. There is no more entertaining way to gain insight into the early development and popularisation of computing than by flicking
                            though magazines such as <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3j4EAAAAMBAJ">InfoWorld</a>. In the issue from <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=3j4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover">May 25, 1981</a> on pages
                            1, 7 and 60 you will see references to <strong>The Last One</strong>, a new software product produced by a British company called <em>D.J. "AI" Systems</em>, which is described on page 1 as <em>"one of the most significant software products ever created"</em>.
                            Judging from its very brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_One_(software)" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>, The Last One did not quite live up to its hype. Nevertheless, the idea behind it was interesting,
                            and seemed to have great potential. The goal of The Last one is described as <em>"to give the computer all the low-level chores involved in coding and debugging programs, thus leaving to people only the general design of the software"</em>.</p>
                        <p>The idea that code could be created automatically (or at least-semi automatically) is certainly attractive. One can imagine that this would lead to much quicker program development, perhaps more reliable programs, and could possibly
                            enable one to develop software that would be too complex for human coders to develop without some automated help.</p>
                        <p>Automated coding can actually take many forms, ranging from simple <em>autocompletion</em> of variable and function names to fully automatic creation of a program from a natural language description, or from a set of sample inputs
                            and outputs. The general aim of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_programming">automatic programming</a> has actually led to several different research fields being explored, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis">Program Synthesis</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/PBE/">Programming by Example</a></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The prospects for automatic programming are uncertain. Some take the view that it is impractical or even impossible because of the many technical challenges it presents; and that more traditional programming ideas, such as modularisation
                            and abstraction, provide a more realistic route to achieving quicker, more reliable and more advanced software development.</p>

                        <p>Closely related to automatic coding, is the idea that a computer program could modify its own code. This is not allowed by the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Self-modifying_code">Von Neumann Architecture</a>, which keeps programs and data separate, but is possible with nearly all modern computers, in which the same
                            memory is used to store programs and the data operated on by programs (thus they can potentially change their code in much the same way that they operate on data). In Python is easy to write code that modifies itself (for example,
                            by creating strings representing function definitions and executing them using the <code>eval</code> command). The problem is that it is very difficult to do this in a way that would not cause unpredictable behaviour and program
                            crashes.</p>
                        <p>Many types of program do in fact modify their code in a limited way. An example of this is <em>genetic algorithms</em>, and most other ML algorithms that use <em>training</em> or <em>reinforcement</em> can be regarded as self modifying.
                            However, these types of algorithms have a main control system that is not modified. I believe that there are no examples of programs that can modify any part of their own code that have been successful in achieving useful functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some have suggested that AI systems can become <em>super-intelligent</em> by modifying their own code. We will consider this possibility later in this Unit in the lesson on <strong>Dangers of AI</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Clearly there are many difficult problems that will need to be overcome for the development of new software capabilities and novel applications. Here we shall just look at a few that seem particularly significant and challenging.</p>

                        <p>The problem of natural language understanding is generally regarded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete#AI-complete_problems">AI-complete</a>, meaning that solving it is equivalent to the problem of creating Artificial
                            General Intelligence (i.e. Strong AI). That language is central to intelligence, especially in the view of those advocating symbolic approaches to AI, was discussed in Unit 5, in the lesson on <strong>Approaches to AI</strong>.
                            And informally, we can argue that, if an artificial agent is capable of holding an intelligent conversation, it must be intelligent. This is the basis upon which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>                            and also underlies the idea of the
                            <a href="http://commonsensereasoning.org/winograd.html">Winograd Schema Challenge</a> which involves the correct interpretation of certain kinds of sentence known as

                        <p>During the early development of AI,
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> problems were mainly approached using symbolic AI techniques such as
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsing</a> algorithms and knowledge representation languages. However, more recently the problem has increasingly been tackled using ML techniques. Over the past few years, models
                            based on ANNs trained on very large corpora of text data, have been developed, which can, with a high degree of accuracy, perform language processing tasks that seem to require some level of understanding. Most prominent among
                            these is the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)">BERT language model</a>. More information about BERT can be found in the articles at

                        <p>The problem of natural language understanding will no doubt be a major subject of AI research for many years to come. It seems unlikely that it will be fully solved in the near future; however, it is very likely that its study
                            will lead to the development of many new programming ideas both in terms of algorithms and information representation.</p>

                        <p>Suppose I wake up and realise that I need to go to the university to deliver a lecture. In order to do this I need to formulate and carry out some kind of plan. This will involve a sequence of high-level goals that I will need
                            to achieve in order to successfully give the lecture:</p>
                        <p>I need to get dressed, have some breakfast, check the time and place of the lecture, find and pack my laptop, choose a suitable mode of transport (walk, bike, bus?) and route, ..., set up my laptop, turn on the projection equipment.
                            Finally, I am ready to give the lecture.</p>
                        <p>But each of these high-level tasks also involves a large number of smaller steps that need to be planned and successfully executed. Making breakfast involves opening cupboards and packets and operating kitchen equipment. Eating
                            involves careful coordinated movements and manipulations, otherwise I will cause a lot of mess. Also, in order to get everything done in time, I may need to do some tasks in parallel, such as packing my bag while the kettle
                            is boiling. To complicate things further still, not all plans may work out as intended: maybe my laptop is not on the desk where I expected it to be; I have to look round the flat and finally locate it on the sofa.</p>
                        <p>Although AI planning systems can compute quite long action sequences to achieve goals, the scenario described in the previous paragraph presents a planning problem that is far more complex than any modern AI planning algorithm
                            would have any chance of solving. Humans, somehow seem to be able to split up planning problems naturally into different tasks and levels of granularity, so that our decision making at any one point in our activity is quite
                            focussed despite there being a huge degree of potential interaction between different goals (somehow I forget about my laptop while making breakfast even though spilling tea on it could make it impossible to give my lecture).
                            And we also seem to be able to adapt minor parts of our plans quite easily when things turn out a bit different from what was expected.</p>
                        <p>Tackling this kind of problem has been regarded as a key problem for AI since its beginnings (see papers such as
                            <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog0202_1"><em>Planning and Acting</em></a>, <a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/5026/TR_90-78.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><em>Knowledge Strata: reactive planning with

                            Unfortunately, automated reasoning using logical representations and inference is extremely computationally expensive. What is more, for many logical languages, testing inference can be

                            to represent a wide range of different kinds of information and the fact that inferences can derived automatically mean that automated reasoning is very attractive as a mechanism to be used within an AI system.</p>
                        <p>At one time (around the 80s) <em>artificial neural nets</em> (which were overviewed in the lesson on <strong>Approaches to AI</strong> in Unit 5) were considered to be a promising approach to develop AI systems. But they went out
                            of fashion when it seemed that it was not possible to achieve useful functionality using this approach, at least not with the computing power that was available at that time. But of course with the computing power that is now
                            available it has been found that extremely impressive functionality can be achieved from ANN-based systems.</p>
                        <p>The field of Automated Reasoning could be in a similar situation. Although research in this area has continued from the earliest days of AI to the present day, in recent years it has been considered by many to be an implausible
                            route to achieving significant AI capabilities. This has been due both to the computational power required and also to problems in representing the knowledge required to support reasoning. Since computing power has continued
                            to increase and there is much scope for further development knowledge representation methods (including by combining with ML techniques), it is likely that there will be significant future developments in automated reasoning,
                            which could make it a powerful component of AI systems.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned in the lesson on <strong>Approaches to AI</strong> in Unit 5, there is often scepticism from researchers in one of these areas to work following the other approach. However, it is increasingly recognised that there
                            are many ways in which GOFAI and ML can be combined to develop advanced software capabilities.</p>
                        <p>In fact systems such as AI game playing agents often use search algorithms that are guided by heuristic functions that have been discovered by ML techniques. Symbolic KR can provide powerful reasoning capabilities, but these are
                            limited both by the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge required to support the reasoning and the problem guiding the reasoning process towards making the desired inferences. It is possible that both these issues could be
                            addressed by utilising ML within a symbolic reasoning system.</p>
                        <p>It is likely that investigation of possible ways to combine Symbolic AI and ML would be a very active research area in the future.</p>

                        <p>In theory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum computing</a> can implement certain algorithms much faster than is possible with conventional hardware. Quantum algorithms make use of the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>                            to combine multiple items of information within a single quantum state (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">Qubit</a>). This enables massive parallelism for certain types of algorithm which could potentially mean
                            that an algorithm that is of exponential time complexity on conventional machines could require only polynomial time if implemented on a quantum computer (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a>,
                            which can be used to crack cryptographic encoding).</p>

                        <p>It is possible that quantum computing could massively increase the power of computers over the coming decades. However this is by no means certain. There are many technical issues that make construction and reliable operation of
                            quantum computers extremely difficult. Furthermore, although quantum computing may reduce the complexity of a certain type of problems it is by no means clear that it gives significant advantage in solving the kinds of NP-hard
                            search problem that are typically employed of Symbolic AI. (This article on <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/The_Limits_of_Quantum_Computers.pdf"><em>The Limits of Quantum</em></a> provides an accessible and entertaining
                            exploration of this issue.)</p>

                        <p>As computers become more and more closely integrated in to human life they affect us in many ways. They may change or replace our roles and affect our experience in our work, leisure and social interactions. It is clear that computers
                            can provide significant benefits but they may also have negative affects on us. What I refer to as
                            <em>human compatibility issues</em> covers all aspects of the interactions between humans and computers and potential problems that can occur. Addressing these issues will increasingly become a major topic of study in relation
                            to technical design, and also to legal regulation and social policies. We shall cover issues concerning the most serious kinds of compatibility issue in more detail later in this unit, in the lesson on <strong>Dangers of AI</strong>.</p>
